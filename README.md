# STUDIES ON AUTOMATING THE SEGMENTATION OF X-RAY IMAGES WITH DEEP
NEURAL NETWORKS

This project is a 02456 Deep Learning Course Final Project

###Â ABSTRACT
X-ray imaging widespread used technique for medical and
interdisciplinary research fields. Increasing number of re-
searches in this field brings some additional requirements and
issues with it. X-ray Imaging outputs needs to be segmented
for diverse tasks. This segementation tasks are handled man-
ually in many researches. However manual segmentation
bring many issues with it such as time consuming due to
huge datasets, noise in images bring challenges in segmenta-
tion. This study delves into complexities and challenges in
X-Ray image segmentation task. This project emphasis on
segmentation of X-ray images using Deep Neural Networks,
with specific focus on ResNeXt and VGGNet architectures.
Different studies conducted to evaluate performance of pro-
posed architectures. These studies include Training models
with smaller images, transfer learning to test bigger images,
testing models with different level of noised data and finally
training models with less data. Through different studies, this
project tried to increase efficiency and accuracy on automat-
ing the segmentation of X-ray images.
